Bluenet, a mesh combined with Bluetooth Low-Energy.

# Bluenet Documentation

This documentation describes the features of the Bluenet firmware. If you are not on the http://dobots.github.io/bluenet/ page, you can navigate to it, to read this in your browser.

# Bluenet Code

The code for the firmware can be found at https://github.com/dobots/bluenet.

# Crownstone

The product that makes use of this firmware is the crownstone, which is currently one of the core technologies developed at DoBots. At the moment the status is just before launching our product, so as a development inclined person, you can see our work on github (and in this documentation) as a sneak preview.
